    <h3>The Lisp Bookshelf</h3>

<p>So I've obviously been paying a lot of attention to this
site lately... so much so that I'm thinking of some sort of excuse for
explaining the absence of decent reading material.</p>

<p>Jokes aside, I've recently gone through spells of intense study and absolute
laziness. However, I have come across a gem of a website that has inspired this
post, <a href="http://programming-musings.org">Programming-Musings</a> by Jose Antonio
Ortega Ruiz (Jao).</p>

<p>Jao is mainly a Scheme hacker and is the author of the well-known
<a href="http://www.nongnu.org/geiser/">Geiser</a> project, an interactive environment for
Scheme in Emacs. I found his website by accident through a post in
<a href="http://news.ycombinator.com">Hacker News</a>, and read his post
<a href="http://programming-musings.org/2007/01/31/a-scheme-bookshelf/">A Scheme Bookshelf</a>
which detailed his road to Scheme mastery.</p>

<p>I've been thinking of writing a similar post on my own study path of Common Lisp
and reading his account finally made me decide to get on with it.</p>

<p>My first contact with Lisp came through the incredible book <em>Structure and
Interpretation of Computer Programs</em> <a href="mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/">SICP</a> for short.
<img class="img-responsive pull-left gap-right" src="/img/sicp.gif"/> I got through maybe
3 or 4 chapters before being overwhelmed by some of the mathematics (I'm not
portraying a very flattering picture of myself here...) but then again this
<em>was</em> about 3 years ago, I'd like to think I'd be able to hold my own by now.</p>

<p>Anyway, despite the lack of ability that caused my abandonment of SICP (I'm
planning to take it up again after I finish the book I'm currently reading), I
didn't give up on learning Lisp and started reading another often recommended
book, <em>HTDP</em> or <a href="http://htdp.org/">How to Design Programs</a> <img
class="img-responsive pull-right" src="/img/htdp.jpg">. Although I did learn a
few interesting and valuable methods like design-by-contract, for the most part
it was difficult to maintain my enthusiasm and drive to finish the book, and I
dropped it after the 4th or 5th chapter.</p>

<p>Enter <a href="http://www.gigamonkeys.com/book/">Practical Common Lisp</a> <img
class="img-responsive pull-left gap-right" src="/img/pcl.jpg"> by Peter Seibel. This book
was touted as <em>the</em> book from which one could enter the magical land of Lisp
hacking... and yet even here I only managed to get through a few chapters before
finally abandoning it.</p>

<p>At this point I was beginning to lose hope and think that I would never be
initiated into the secret brotherhood of Lisp hackers, I had failed to read
through not one, not two, but <strong>three</strong> of the recommended books for novices
beginning their journey. This was quite discouraging and I was about to call it
quits when I came across <a href="http://landoflisp.com/">Land of Lisp</a>. <img
class="img-responsive pull-right" src="/img/lol.png" style="width:10em;"> This is
the book that finally started me on the path to enlightenment... and is probably
to blame for my current Lisp superiority complex.</p>

<p>Quite a few hackers actually don't recommend this book as they say it doesn't
teach and show idiomatic Common Lisp, I'm not experienced enough to argue either
way but I <em>can</em> say that without this book I probably would still be floundering
around. Whether or not it does teach best practices, what this book does do is
engage the amateur Lisper and give him glimpses of the magic that is present in
Lisp land.</p>

<p>After having finished Land of Lisp, I started reading Peter Norvig's
<a href="http://norvig.com/paip.html">Paradigms of Artificial Intelligence Programming</a>
<img class="img-responsive pull-left gap-right" src="/img/paip-cover.gif"
style="width:10em">, this is where one can starts to truly see the beauty and
power of Lisp, as well as more <em>idiomatic</em> code. It takes the reader through
past A.I. projects done in the 70s and 80s and how Lisp can/was/is implemented
to solve those problems. I do have to hit <strong>#lisp</strong> at freenode and consult with
the <a href="http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Front/">Hyper Spec</a> quite
often, but if the reader is independent and not dependent on being spoon-fed
then this book will take him to the next level.</p>

<p>From this point as I am still reading it, I will post the books that I <em>plan</em> on
reading after finishing and digesting PAIP.</p>

<p>I plan on tackling SICP again and at the same time go through
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/books/dp/0521545668">Lisp In Small Pieces</a> by Christian
Queinnec. This after reading Jao's review on said book. <img
class="img-responsive pull-right" src="/img/l.i.s.p.jpg"> It seems to be the
<a href="http://dragonbook.stanford.edu/">Dragon Book</a> equivalent for Lisp, describing
11 interpreters and 2 compilers.</p>

<p>After the SICP and L.I.S.P duo, I plan on reading either
<a href="http://paulgraham.com/">Paul Graham's</a>
<a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/onlisp.html">On Lisp</a> or Doug Hoyte's
<a href="http://letoverlambda.com/">Let over Lambda</a> (or maybe both???). Both are said
to deal with extremely advanced programming topics, specifically the Lisp secret
sauce, macros (LoL is supposed to be one of the most hardcore computer
programming books out there). <img class="img-responsive pull-left gap-right"
src="/img/onlisp.jpg" style="width:10em"> <img class="img-responsive pull-left
gap-right" src="/img/lol.jpg" style="width:10em"></p>

<p>Other books that I'm looking at but haven't yet decided when I will dedicate
some time to them are:
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Functional-Programming-Calculus-Mathematics/dp/0486478831">An Introduction to Functional Programming through Lambda Calculus</a>.
While the book's title suggests that the Functional-style paradigm is the core
of the text, according to various reviews it's a great introduction to the
Lambda Calculus itself. I've been wanting to start reading up on the Lambda
Calculus and this just might be the way in.</p>

<p>Another seemingly interesting book is
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Common-LISP-Modules-Artificial-Intelligence/dp/0387976140">Common Lisp Modules: Artificial Intelligence in the Era of Neural Networks and Chaos Theory</a>.
I've always been interested in Neural Networks and the chance of learning how to
implement them in Lisp sounds too good. According to the book description it
also contains speech and handwriting recognition code, a computer chess game,
and other goodies.</p>

<p>Rounding out the collection are two books that apparently complement each other.
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Object-Oriented-Programming-COMMON-LISP-Programmers/dp/0201175894">Object Oriented Programming in Common Lisp</a>
and
<a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/art-metaobject-protocol">The Art of the Meta Object Protocol</a>
both deal with CLOS, the Common Lisp Object System. Object Oriented Programming
in Common Lisp is supposed to be the <em>gentle</em> yet useful introduction to CLOS
while The Art of the Meta Object Protocol, written by some of the developers of
CLOS, dives into the actual implementation of the meta object protocol in CLOS
and how to modify its behavior.</p>

<p><em>Unfortunately I couldn't find the websites of some of the books so I've linked
 to their Amazon page</em></p>
