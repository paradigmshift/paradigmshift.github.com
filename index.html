    <h3>The Lisp Bookshelf</h3>

<p>So I've obviously been paying a lot of attention to this site
lately... so much so that I'm thinking of some sort of excuse for
explaining the absence of decent reading material.</p>

<p>Jokes aside, I've recently gone through spells of intense study and
absolute laziness. However, I have come across a gem of a website that
has inspired this post,
<a href="http://programming-musings.org">Programming-Musings</a> by Jose Antonio
Ortega Ruiz (Jao).</p>

<p>Jao is mainly a Scheme hacker and is the author of the well-known
<a href="http://www.nongnu.org/geiser/">Geiser</a> project, an interactive environment
for Scheme in Emacs. I found his website by accident through a post
in <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com">Hacker News</a>, and read his post
<a href="http://programming-musings.org/2007/01/31/a-scheme-bookshelf/">A Scheme Bookshelf</a>
which detailed his road to Scheme mastery.</p>

<p>I've been thinking of writing a similar post on my own study path of Common
Lisp and reading his account finally made me decide to get on with it.</p>

<p>My first contact with Lisp came through the incredible book <em>Structure
and Interpretation of Computer Programs</em>
<a href="mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/">SICP</a> for short. <img class="floatleft"
src="/img/sicp.gif"/> I got through maybe 3 or 4 chapters before being
overwhelmed by some of the mathematics (I'm not portraying a very
flattering picture of myself here...) but then again this <em>was</em> about
3 years ago, I'd like to think I'd be able to hold my own by now.</p>

<p>Anyway, despite the lack of ability that caused my abandonment of
SICP (I'm planning to take it up again after I finish the book I'm
currently reading), I didn't give up on learning Lisp and started
reading another often recommended book, <em>HTDP</em> or
<a href="http://htdp.org/">How to Design Programs</a> <img class="floatright"
src="/img/htdp.jpg">. Although I did learn a few interesting and
valuable methods like design-by-contract, for the most part it was
difficult to maintain my enthusiasm and drive to finish the book, and
I dropped it after the 4th or 5th chapter.</p>

<p>Enter <a href="http://www.gigamonkeys.com/book/">Practical Common Lisp</a> <img
class="floatleft" src="/img/pcl.jpg"> by Peter Seibel. This book was
touted as <em>the</em> book from which one could enter the magical land of
Lisp hacking... and yet even here I only managed to get through a few
chapters before finally abandoning it.</p>

<p>At this point I was beginning to lose hope and think that I would
never be initiated into the secret brotherhood of Lisp hackers, I had
failed to read through not one, not two, but <strong>three</strong> of the
recommended books for novices beginning their journey. This was quite
discouraging and I was about to call it quits when I came across
<a href="http://landoflisp.com/">Land of Lisp</a>. <img class="floatright"
src="/img/lol.png" style="width:10em;"> This is the book that finally started me on the
path to enlightenment... and is probably to blame for my current Lisp superiority
complex.</p>

<p>Quite a few hackers actually don't recommend this book as they say it
doesn't teach and show idiomatic Common Lisp, I'm not experienced
enough to argue either way but I <em>can</em> say that without this book I
probably would still be floundering around. Whether
or not it does teach best practices, what this book does do is engage
the amateur Lisper and give him glimpses of the magic that is present
in Lisp land.</p>

<p>After having finished Land of Lisp, I started reading Peter Norvig's
<a href="http://norvig.com/paip.html">Paradigms of Artificial Intelligence Programming</a>
<img class="floatleft" src="/img/paip-cover.gif" style="width:10em">, this is where one
can starts to truly see the beauty and power of Lisp, as well as more
<em>idiomatic</em> code. It takes the reader through past A.I. projects done
in the 70s and 80s and how Lisp can/was/is implemented to solve those
problems. I do have to hit <strong>#lisp</strong> at freenode and consult with the
<a href="http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Front/">Hyper Spec</a>
quite often, but if the reader is independent and not dependent on
being spoon-fed then this book will take him to the next level.</p>

<p>From this point as I am still reading it, I will post the books that
I <em>plan</em> on reading after finishing and digesting PAIP.</p>

<p>I plan on tackling SICP again and at the same time go through <a href="http://www.amazon.com/books/dp/0521545668">Lisp In
Small Pieces</a> by Christian
Queinnec. This after reading Jao's review on said book. <img
class="floatright" src="/img/l.i.s.p.jpg"> It seems to be the <a href="http://dragonbook.stanford.edu/">Dragon
Book</a> equivalent for Lisp, describing
11 interpreters and 2 compilers.</p>

<p>After the SICP and L.I.S.P duo, I plan on reading either
<a href="http://paulgraham.com/">Paul Graham's</a>
<a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/onlisp.html">On Lisp</a> or Doug Hoyte's <a href="http://letoverlambda.com/">Let
over Lambda</a> (or maybe both???). Both are
said to deal with extremely advanced programming topics, specifically
the Lisp secret sauce, macros (LoL is supposed to be one of the
most hardcore computer programming books out there). <img
class="floatleft" src="/img/onlisp.jpg" style="width:10em">
<img class="floatleft" src="/img/lol.jpg" style="width:10em"></p>

<p>Other books that I'm looking at but haven't yet decided when I will dedicate some time to them are:
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Functional-Programming-Calculus-Mathematics/dp/0486478831">An Introduction to Functional Programming through Lambda Calculus</a>.
While the book's title suggests that the Functional-style paradigm is
the core of the text, according to various reviews it's a great
introduction to the Lambda Calculus itself. I've been wanting to start
reading up on the Lambda Calculus and this just might be the way in.</p>

<p>Another seemingly interesting book is
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Common-LISP-Modules-Artificial-Intelligence/dp/0387976140">Common Lisp Modules: Artificial Intelligence in the Era of Neural Networks and Chaos Theory</a>.
I've always been interested in Neural Networks and the chance of
learning how to implement them in Lisp sounds too good. According to
the book description it also contains speech and handwriting
recognition code, a computer chess game, and other goodies.</p>

<p>Rounding out the collection are two books that apparently complement
each other.
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Object-Oriented-Programming-COMMON-LISP-Programmers/dp/0201175894">Object Oriented Programming in Common Lisp</a>
and
<a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/art-metaobject-protocol">The Art of the Meta Object Protocol</a>
both deal with CLOS, the Common Lisp Object System. Object Oriented
Programming in Common Lisp is supposed to be the <em>gentle</em> yet useful
introduction to CLOS while The Art of the Meta Object Protocol,
written by some of the developers of CLOS, dives into the actual
implementation of the meta object protocol in CLOS and how to modify
its behavior.</p>

<p><em>Unfortunately I couldn't find the websites of some of the books so
 I've linked to their Amazon page</em></p>
